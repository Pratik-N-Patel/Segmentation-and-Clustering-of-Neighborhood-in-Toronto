# Segmentation-and-Clustering-of-Neighborhood-in-Toronto
Explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. Firstly, scraped the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, cleaned it, and then loaded it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format.
Once the data is in a structured format, explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
